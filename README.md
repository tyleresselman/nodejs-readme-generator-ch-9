# Node.js README Generator App - Challenge 9

## Description

This challenge was focused on us using node.js to create a command line application that would present the user with a series of prompts and take the input responses and generate a professional quality README document from their answers. We were asked to use the Inquirer node package which made the process of asking the user questions quite simple. From there, it was simply a matter of capturing the user's information and rendering it into a waiting markdown file with the proper formatting for a README document that one might see included with a GitHUb repository. This assignment made a lot of sense to me, for which I am grateful. The back-end technology is intuitive and I was able to employ my improving understanding of Javascript along with some new syntactical tools (ES6) to make a functional, fairly clean app.
